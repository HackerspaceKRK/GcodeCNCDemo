#Hackerspace Krak√≥w Low Budget CNC (LBCNC)

Simplest firmware for bipolar 4-wire stepper motors powered CNC machines on g-code diet.
Makes use Arduino Mega due to 4 pins per motor required.
* X axis is connected to pins 30-33
* Y axis is connected to pins 34-37
* Z axis is connected to pins 38-42

(Makka Pakka not included.)

##Which files should I use?

* If you are testing out X-Y table then use 2axis.ino .
* If you already made some wood works and have also Z axis, then use 4axis.ino .

##Prerequisites

* Arduino: http://arduino.cc/
* A lot of hot glue
* Some more hot glue
